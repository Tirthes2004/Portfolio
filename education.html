            <p class="intro">I take my first step towards education from <span>Vivekananda Vidhyapith</span>. I was a exciting student in school, sports is a thing which is always eye-catching to me. I actively participated in all the events and tournaments which were occurred in my school. <br><br> After passing 5th standard I got the life changing opportunity to be a part of <span>Sarisha Ramakrishna Mission Siksha Mandir (H.S)</span>. Here all the stuffs are very handy and cooperative. I'd spent my  precious 6 years to gather knowledge and be more discipline in everyday life.  Due to unavailability of hostel facilities I've to leave Ramakrishna Mission after passing my secondary examination. <br><br> After that I pursue my higher secondary education from <span>Bargachia Union Priyanatha Pathasala</span>. <br><br> After higher secondary exam I got the chance to be a family member of <span> Techno Main Salt Lake</span>. I'm feeling blessed to be one among all the students. Looking forward to gather a lot of knowledge to make my future enlighten.</p>
